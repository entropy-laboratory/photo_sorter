# 📸 Image Sorting and Visual Gradient Classifier

This project provides a set of Python scripts for **analyzing, categorizing**, and **sorting image collections** based on **visual characteristics** using machine learning and heuristic rules.

It is ideal for photographers, digital artists, and content creators who wish to bring order to large collections of images by automatically assigning them into visual categories and placing them along a perceptual **gradient spectrum**.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Automatic **image feature extraction** (color histograms, brightness, saturation, entropy, edge density)
- ✅ **Face detection** for portrait classification
- ✅ PCA-based **gradient scoring** for perceptual image sorting
- ✅ Heuristic-based **category assignment**:
  - Vibrant
  - Pastel
  - Monochrome
  - Dark
  - Nature
  - Urban
  - Portrait
  - Abstract
  - Other
- ✅ Sorted export with filename prefix (position, gradient value, category)
- ✅ Logging and summary of results
- ✅ Easily configurable folder paths

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
project/
├── image_sorting_gradient.py     # Main script
├── [your images folder]          # Input image folder
├── sortedNEWMETHOD/
│   ├── gradient/                 # Sorted images with gradient filenames
│   └── gradient_info.txt         # Detailed output with features and scores
```

## 🧠 How it Works

1. **Feature Extraction**: Each image is resized and analyzed to extract visual features (dominant colors, histograms, entropy, edge density, etc.).
2. **Categorization**: Images are heuristically assigned to one of several predefined visual categories.
3. **Gradient Computation**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to place each image along a single visual axis (gradient).
4. **Sorting and Export**: Images are renamed and copied in order of increasing gradient value with metadata in filename.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Install dependencies (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib pandas pillow
```

2. Adjust folder paths in the script:

```python
source_folder = r"your\path\to\images"
destination_folder = r"your\output\path"
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python image_sorting_gradient.py
```

Sorted images will be available in `sortedNEWMETHOD/gradient/` with gradient-based prefixes.

## 📝 Example Filename

```
023_0.362_04_dark_IMG1234.jpg
```

- `023`: Position in gradient
- `0.362`: Gradient score (from 0 to 1)
- `04_dark`: Assigned category
- `IMG1234.jpg`: Original filename

---

## 📊 Output Summary

At the end of the run, you'll get:

- A console breakdown of how many images were assigned to each category.
- A `gradient_info.txt` file listing all scores and assigned labels.
- A perceptually ordered image collection ready for curation or publishing.

## 🧪 Scripts

This project consists of multiple versions:

1. **Basic categorizer** – sorts images into categories using heuristics.
2. **Gradient sorter** – performs PCA-based sorting using visual features.
3. **Full version (this script)** – combines categorization + gradient + output.
